I think there is a consistent trend. Huffman cost is a much more than fixed-length cost for all the cases and as fixed-length cost increases, huffman cost increases.


- **e.**

The frequency of encoding times multiplied by the durations of the encoding times combined together gives the projected cost of a Huffman encoding for the document, and it is consistent across the document.
